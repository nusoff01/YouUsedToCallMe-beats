The idea - create a unique song based on a sentiment number

Decisions that the algorithm takes:

	- Chord based or single notes
	- key
	- register
	- ...


Sounds and their corresponding sentiment value


MUSIC SENTIMENT FACTORS

dissonance 
major vs. minor
chord progressions

TODO - between now and 3 am

- change attacks/volumes: louder base for negative, softer for positive   |  +++
- start implementing by percentages instead of purely (+) and (-)         | 
- figure out how to wrap everything in a function						  |
